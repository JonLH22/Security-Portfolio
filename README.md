# ReconX: Automated Web Reconnaissance Framework
A modular Python-based tool for DNS enumeration, URL discovery, and web reconnaissance.

## Overview
ReconX is a lightweight, Python-based reconnaissance tool designed to streamline early-stage information gathering for ethical hacking, CTFs, and bug bounty programs.  

It automates several common recon steps such as DNS lookup, historical URL collection, and directory discovery — helping researchers quickly map targets and identify attack surfaces.

## Features
✅ DNS enumeration (nslookup, dig)  
✅ URL discovery using Wayback Machine  
✅ Directory fuzzing (ffuf, dirbuster integration)  
✅ Output logging and target tracking  

**Planned features:**
- [ ] Subdomain enumeration  
- [ ] Screenshot capture  
- [ ] Docker integration  
- [ ] Network traffic analysis module

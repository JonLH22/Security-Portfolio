# Security-Portfolio


I’m an ethical hacker and IT professional transitioning from systems administration into full-time offensive security.
I specialize in web application testing, recon automation, and vulnerability research — and I’m currently expanding my skills through CTFs, bug bounty programs, and hands-on projects.

As part of Lost Rabbit Labs, I collaborate on community-driven research and CTF challenges to keep my technical edge sharp. My recent projects include developing a Python-based recon automation tool and documenting exploitation workflows for learning and open sharing.

I’m currently seeking a full-time penetration testing or security analyst role where I can contribute to real-world security testing, vulnerability assessment, and continuous learning.

Core skills: Web app security, OWASP Top 10, Python scripting, recon & automation, Burp Suite, Nmap, Ghidra, Linux, CTFs, and vulnerability triage.

In this you will find my projects, write ups, and other general info about what I am doing in my ethical hacking journey!
